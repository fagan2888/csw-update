# Installation
If you don't have Pip, [get Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)!

Either clone the repo or [download as a zip](https://github.com/CIC-Geospatial-Data-Discovery-Project/csw-update/archive/master.zip. Once cloned/downloaded and extracted, execute this command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configuration
1. Make a copy of `config.py.sample`
2. Name it `config.py`
3. Fill in `CSW_URL`, `USER`, and `PASSWORD`
4. (Optional) Set DEBUG to True for more detailed execution information.

# Export from GeoNetwork
Export a CSV for the records you want to edit via spreadsheet. We use a custom CSV export for the CIC: GDDP (mainly for link handling), but as long as you have the `uuid` field, the tool should work with the out of the box CSV export.

# Spreadsheet Input Structural Requirements
- The input file format **must be** `csv`. Excel formats (`xls` or `xlsx`) are not supported.
- There **must be** a column called `uuid`. The values in it should correspond to the fileIdentifier for the records being updated. For example: `bdfc5cd2-732d-4559-a9c7-df38dd683aec`.

# CSV column formatting
When working with a CSV exported from GeoNetwork, you'll need to either:
1. **PREFERRED** Insert a new column, name it according to the table below and add your new values into it. (empty cells will be ignored, so if you want to null out a value, too bad I suppose. Let me know if you really need to do this and I can work in that functionality).
2. Change column names to the appropriate Column Header listed below (this is not really well tested, but ought to work, I guess)
